Answers to questions:
Task 9:
If we will write the code lines given twice, on the second time nothing will
 happen, because the iterator is not iterable, means that after the first
 time the iteration iterates over all the nodes on queue, the current
 variable keeps the each time the current node on queue will be None because
 on the last iteration on the queue (the last node), current will be set as
 None and the last task will be returned.

Task 10:
Now, if we will the code lines given twice, the tasks will be printed twice
as expected, and that because every time we iterate over the queue, the
program initiates a new PriorityQueueIterator object, means each iteration
iterates the whole queue from beginning.
